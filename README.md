The National Revenue Agency and Ernst & Young Bulgaria are implementing a project to implement the international SAF-T standard. Within the framework of the project, the conditions for collecting data in a unified format based on SAF-T are being studied and prepared for implementation.

The upcoming introduction of SAF-T in our country will speed up the overall digitalization process in the provision of administrative services, specifically improving the interaction between the tax administration and business.
